## Why This Project Exists

This project is not only a functional tool but also my way of learning Go by solving real-world problems. By working on this project, Iâ€™m hoping to gain hands-on experience with:

* writing clean, idiomatic Go code
* structuring a project with modular and reusable packages
* designing user-friendly tools for developers

If you notice areas where the project can be improved or optimized, Iâ€™d greatly appreciate your feedback or contributions! This is as much a learning experience for me as it is a functional tool for developers. ðŸ˜Š

### Main Areas Covered by This Project

* System-level operations:
    * modifying system files like `/etc/hosts`.
    * managing services such as Apache and DNS resolvers.

* File handling and I/O:
    * reading and writing configuration files (e.g., Apache virtual hosts).
    * safely manipulating directories and files.

* Command-Line Interface (CLI) development:
    * building a user-friendly CLI tool with subcommands, flags, and interactive prompts.
    * supporting advanced features like Dry-Run mode and logging.

* Process management:
    * running external system commands (e.g., `sudo`, `apachectl`) and handling their outputs/errors.
    * restarting services and flushing DNS cache programmatically.

* Error handling and logging:
    * implementing robust error handling for critical operations.
    * logging messages with timestamps and color-coded feedback for better user experience.

* Cross-platform builds:
    * exploring Goâ€™s capabilities for compiling native and universal binaries for macOS (ARM64 and AMD64).
