## Why This Project Exists

This project is not only a functional tool but also my way of learning Go by solving real-world problems. By working on this project, Iâ€™m hoping to gain hands-on experience with:

* writing clean, idiomatic Go code
* structuring a project with modular and reusable packages
* designing user-friendly tools for developers

If you notice areas where the project can be improved or optimized, Iâ€™d greatly appreciate your feedback or contributions! This is as much a learning experience for me as it is a functional tool for developers. ðŸ˜Š

### Main Areas Covered by This Project

* System-Level Operations:
    * Modifying system files like /etc/hosts.
    * Managing services such as Apache and DNS resolvers.

* File Handling and I/O:
    * Reading and writing configuration files (e.g., Apache virtual hosts).
    * Safely manipulating directories and files.

* Command-Line Interface (CLI) Development:
    * Building a user-friendly CLI tool with subcommands, flags, and interactive prompts.
    * Supporting advanced features like dry-run mode and logging.

* Process Management:
    * Running external system commands (e.g., sudo, apachectl) and handling their outputs/errors.
    * Restarting services and flushing DNS cache programmatically.

* Error Handling and Logging:
    * Implementing robust error handling for critical operations.
    * Logging messages with timestamps and color-coded feedback for better user experience.

* Cross-Platform Builds:
    * Exploring Goâ€™s capabilities for compiling native and universal binaries for macOS (ARM64 and AMD64).
